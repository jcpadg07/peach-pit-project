My website showcase

This is a design studio website I created to double as a resume page and a starter business page.  It exhibits my elementary skills I am
still in the process of learning.  It demonstrates my basic skills of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

The only real instruction needed for the site is to follow the link on the landing page to the main page.  

The main page has links to navigate to different information and to a form that will eventually send information to myself using a back end
language after I complete my current front end course.  For now, it captures the input information and shows it in an alert box when 
submitted.

Please feel free to leave comments and send suggestions for improvement!
