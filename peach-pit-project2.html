            <section>
                <h4>Early Life</h4>
                My name is James Carter Padgett and I am a developer, but I haven't always been one... I remember reading science
                fiction books when I was much too young to understand them.  I would look at the pictures on the cover and inside to try
                to develop the story in my mind.  Maybe I was a developer.  I didn't know the actual content.  I would create the plots 
                on my own.  I would imagine robots taking over the world.  The protagonist, or "good guy" at my age, would have to disarm 
                them by typing furiously to dismantle their legion of metal soldiers.  I would "type" with my hands on the table pretending 
                that I was the hero and I had the knowledge to save the day.   I would continue doing this as my way of playing the parts 
                in my head.  I remember when they first home computers were starting to pop up at friends and family member's houses.  I 
                would again put my hands to the keys and start typing furiously.  Of course,  I still didn't know how to type so it was 
                jibberish or I wouldn't have a program open at all.  I would just pretend to dismantle the robot army.

                <h4>Growing Up</h4>
                My fascination didn't stop when I got older.  I enjoy technology and the use of it to simplify our world.
                It connects all of us on the planet in one way or another.  The great information highway that allows all of human knowledge 
                to be available at all times.  We use this technology to learn, teach, and share in a way that has completely altered 
                our way of life as human beings.  It will continue to change our lives each and every day going forward.  I owe my education
                to it and the ability to study anywhere.  I have a degree in Natural Sciences because of it.  My passion for the Earth
                and protecting it grows because of it.  I am studying front end web development to begin my life as a software developer.
                I will use that knowledge to spread awareness of how important our environment is to us.  I will create applications that 
                can educate others on how to be protector instead of just a consumer.  This is my mission in this industry.  I want to help
                other people help others and the Earth.  I am a developer of the web and of the mind.

                <h4>Designs</h4>
                I have been influenced by nature throughout all of my life.  In the beginning,  I remember collecting sticks and trying to make
                things out of them.  I would create little structures by using gravity or maybe some rope if I could find it.  I would collect 
                different things such as leaves or rocks that I found interesting.  Nature is art.  It is inspiration.  I find myself lost in its 
                design all of the time.  All I can do is try to match the simple beauty that it displays everyday.  Take a look around at my design 
                work thus far.  I want to demonstrate my own creativity, inspired by nature, throughout all of my development work.  I will continue
                to expand my knowledge of all web development things and showcase them here on my page.  Below I have some designs that I have made 
                for clients to go on invitations and apparel.
